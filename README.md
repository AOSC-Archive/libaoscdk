# libaoscdk

Separated backend library for AOSC DeployKit.

This library parses the [DKIR](docs/dkir-specs.md) and performs installation. Such design allows multiple front-ends to be easily developed and co-exist. The library is specifically designed for the installation process of [AOSC OS][aosc]. For design details of this project, please [RTFM][rtfm] and RTFSC.
